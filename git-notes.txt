there are 3 staging areas while working within git
the first is the working directory
the second is the staging area, where the file is placed after running the git add command
the last area is the repo section, where the file is placed after running the git commit command
the master and the head usually always point to the same circle that was last modified
you can add a branch by using the git branch command with a label for the new branch
you can list what branches are available by running simply git branch, and this also shows which branch you are on
you can switch between branches by running the branch checkout command followed by the title of the branch you wish to select
